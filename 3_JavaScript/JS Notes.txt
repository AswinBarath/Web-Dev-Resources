JavaScript
    JavaScript was created in 1995 by the netscape web browser.
    Think of Javascript as the "verb" to do anything on the website.

    Back in those days every browser started to have their own version of JavaScript.
    So, eventually a standard had to created, which is known as ECMAscript.
    JavaScript and ECMAscript can be used interchangeably.

    JavaScript can used :
        the web, app(instagram), virtual reality (games, apps ...), drones, robotics, backend.
    
    Beauty of JavaScript: it's a file.
    Big web app -> one logic at a time.
