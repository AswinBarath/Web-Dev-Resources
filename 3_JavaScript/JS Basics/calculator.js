// Calculator
// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.
// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

var a = prompt("Enter number 1:")
var b = prompt("Enter number 2:")
let sum = Number(a) + Number(b)
let differnce = a-b
let product = a*b
let quotient = a/b
alert("Hey bro, the sum is="+ sum)
alert("Hey bro, the differnce is="+ differnce)
alert("Hey bro, the product is="+ product)
alert("Hey bro, the quotient is="+ quotient)
