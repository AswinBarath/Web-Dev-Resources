// Avoiding side effects, functional purity.

// Side effect: changing outside world
// Example
let a = 1;
function b() {
    a = 2; // Side effect
}

// Functional purity
//  When you avoid side effects, and
//  We always return something
// Which makes it DETERMINISTIC
// Example
// input (5,10) -> function() -> return value

// What are the two elements of a pure function?
// 1. Deterministic --> always produces the same results given the same inputs
// 2. No Side Effects -->  It does not depend on any state, or data, change during a programâ€™s execution. It must only depend on its input elements.
